[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## What is this?

This is a deployable NodeJS app which allows you to carry out basic GraphQL queries, mutations and subscriptions against the HubSpot REST API.

## Installation

* For Heroku users, click the deploy button above to deploy to your own Heroku environment
* All other users: clone this library and deploy to your own environment

Then browse to the root of your deployed server to interact with the GraphQL Playground and check out the schema!

Built using `graphql-yoga` and lots of developer love.
